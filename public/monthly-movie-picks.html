<h2>November 2023 Pick</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>This is a wacky movie with with a great cast of characters who are all insane in their own quirky, fantastic way. Hilarity ensues in a twisted tail of Mistaken Identities, Rug Ruining, Kidnapping, Ransom, and Bowling.</p>
<hr />
<h2>December 2023 Pick</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Violent Night</h3>
<p>As is in keeping with the season, I've chosen the Christmas movie of this year to be Violent Night. David Harbour does a great impression of a battle-hardened-turned to booze, magical Santa Claus. This is a movie that is campy enough to enjoy while staying away from being self aware. "Merry Christmas, Ya Filthy Animal"!  </p>
<hr />
<h2> January 2024 Pick</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</h3>
<p>This is an amzing film by Quentin Tarantino. he has recreated the 60's in an homage to decadence and depravity, with pulls from real history and unique twists that leave you captivated through a rollercaoster of emotions.</p>
