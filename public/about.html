<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Who hasn't always been a fan of video games in someway. My father taught me to count and do math with Super Mario and Mega-Man. I have spent countless hours in amazing, interactive worlds. The more I played, the more I knew I
  wanted to create these marvelous adventures for others to enjoy.</p>

<p> Most of my life I have been a Home Renovations and Construction Contractor, creating gorgeous and wonderful homes and backyards for families to live in and enjoy. Video Game
  Design and Web Development are another way for me to help people everywhere enjoy the world and many possible worlds within them.
</p>

<p>I have made this change in my life to make exciting fully immersive virtual worlds to help entertain and educate the
  people in the newest and the most technologically advanced ways. Join with me and we can make gaming and education history. </p>
